# DECKER - A Task Management Solution (Under Development)

Hey there,

Welcome to DECKER, my personal project for building a task management software. I'm creating DECKER to offer a simpler and more user-friendly alternative to complicated project management tools like Click-Up. I understand that overwhelming interfaces can make it hard to stay productive, so my goal is to design a interface that maximizes efficiency.

## Exciting Features in the Works

### Scope-Based System
I'm really excited about introducing a scope-based system in DECKER. It will allow you to create custom roles for your team members, giving them specific permissions based on their responsibilities. You can have roles that only edit task statuses, roles with limited abilities, or even an admin role with full access. You'll have the freedom to define roles that fit your team perfectly.

### Automation Features
Automation is key to being more productive, and I have some awesome plans for DECKER. One of the features I'm working on is automated notifications. You'll be able to set up notifications that keep your team members in the loop about task updates. This will make collaboration easier and ensure everyone stays informed.

### Customized Templates
To make task management even simpler, I'm developing customized templates in DECKER. These templates will let you quickly create tasks with predefined properties, saving you valuable time. With just a few clicks, you'll be able to set up tasks without having to enter all the details manually. It'll make your workflow smoother and faster.

### Multi-Platform Messaging
DECKER goes beyond traditional task management solutions. I'm planning to integrate messaging capabilities for platforms like Gmail, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp. This means you'll be able to communicate with your team members directly within DECKER, without needing to switch between different apps. Collaboration will be more convenient than ever.
